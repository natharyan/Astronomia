# Astronomia: let the exploration begin
The main objective of the game is to destroy multiple waves of asteroids with the help of a blaster mounted on the spaceship. After passing each level, the player reaches the next planet in the solar system, starting form Mercury.

## Requirements:
To use this project, you will need the following:

•[pygame](https://pypi.org/project/pygame/)

•[PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

•[MySQL community server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

•[python mysql.connector](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/#description)


Once you login (or sign-up) your data is loaded from the mysql database/a new record is created under your username (if you are signing in for the first time)
and you are taken to the main lobby, where your current spaceship's statistics and the levels you have completed are displayed (which you can play again without losing your data). Once you click on continue/start you are taken to the main-game screen where you have to destroy all incoming asteroids in order to progress to the next level. If you lose then you are taken back to the lobby and if you win then you are taken to the level lobby for the planet corresponding to the next level. From here you can choose to go back to the lobby to see your upgraded ship/replay a level or can progress on to the next level.



## Login screen:
If you are opening the project for the first time, then signing up will create a new record for you in the MySQL database. Otherwise, your progress will be loaded and you will be directed to the main lobby.
